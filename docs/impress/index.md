# Impress

## Description

**First** Node.js server scaled with **multithreading** and extra thin workload
**isolation**. Optimized for **high-intensive** data exchange, rapid development,
and **clean architecture**. Provides everything you need out of the box for
**reliable** and **efficient backend**, network communication with web and mobile
clients, protocol-agnostic **API**, run-time type validation, real-time and
in-memory data processing, and **reliable stateful** services.

**Weak sides**: not a good choice for content publishing including blogs and
online stores, server-side rendering, serving static content and stateless
services.

**Strong sides**: security and architecture for enterprise-level applications,
long-lived connections over websocket to minimize overhead for cryptographic
handshake, no third-party dependencies.

## Quick start

*   See project template: [metarhia/Example](https://github.com/metarhia/Example)
*   Start server with `node server.js`
*   See [documentation and specifications](https://github.com/metarhia/Contracts)

API endpoint example: `application/api/example.1/citiesByCountry.js`

```js
async ({ countryId }) => {
  const fields = ['cityId', 'name'];
  const where = { countryId };
  const data = await db.select('City', fields, where);
  return { result: 'success', data };
};
```

You can call it from client-side:

```js
const res = await metacom.api.example.citiesByCountry({ countryId: 3 });
```

## Metarhia and impress application server way

*   Applied code needs to be simple and secure, so we use sandboxing with v8
    isolated contexts, worker threads and javascript closures;
*   Domain code should be separated from system code; so we use DDD, layered
    (onion) architecture, DI, SOLID and GRASP principles, contract-based approach;
*   Impress supports stateful applications with RPC and client-session sticky to
    servers; microservices, centralized or distributed architecture;
*   No I/O is faster even than async I/O, so we hold state in memory, share it
    among multiple threads and use lazy I/O for persistent storage;
*   We use just internal trusted dependencies, no third-party npm packages;
    total Metarhia technology stack size is less than 2mb.

## Features

*   **Auto API routing**, just create endpoint files as an async function;
*   Code **live reload** with file system watch (when files change on disk);
*   **Graceful shutdown** and application state recovery after reload;
*   **Minimal dependencies** and code size;
*   Can scale with **multiple threads** and servers;
*   Code **sandboxing** for security and context isolation;
*   Auto module loader with **dependency injection** for namespaces;
*   **Layered architecture** out of the box: core, domain, API, client;
*   Utilize multiple CPU cores and serve multiple ports with worker threads;
*   Inter-process communication and shared memory used for state management;
*   State synchronization mechanism with transactions and subscription;
*   Cache server-side executable JavaScript in memory;
*   Rapid **API** development support: AJAX RPC and **Websocket**;
*   Serve static files from memory cache;
*   Application configuration (for different named environments);
*   Database access layer for PostgreSQL and relational db schemas;
*   Persistent sessions support with authentication, groups, and anonymous;
*   Multiple protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS;
*   Logging with buffering (lazy write) and rotation (keep logs N days);
*   File utilities: upload, download, streaming;
*   Built-in simple testing framework;
*   Server health monitoring;
*   Built-in data structures validation and preprocessing library;
*   Task scheduling (interval or certain time);
*   Concurrency control: request queue with timeout and size;
*   Execution timeout and error handling;

## Requirements

*   Node.js v12.9.0 or later (v14 preferred)
*   Linux (tested on Fedora 30, Ubuntu 16, 18, 19 and 20, CentOS 7 and 8)
*   Postgresql 9.5 or later (v11.8 preferred)
*   OpenSSL v1.1.1 or later (optional, for https & wss)
*   [certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot) (recommended but optional)
